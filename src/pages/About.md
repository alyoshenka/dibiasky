## What is this project, exactly?

This project allows you to specify messages and have them be displayed on an LED board, either instantaneously or at a scheduled time in the future, even while away from your local network. 

## How does it work?

This project is made up of four key sub-projects:
- [Neo](https://github.com/alyoshenka/neo): Local device application that can receive messages from the cloud
- [Neopolitan](https://github.com/alyoshenka/neopolitan): Drawing library
- [Dibiasky](https://github.com/alyoshenka/dibiasky): Web application that facilitates communication between the cloud and a local device (*You're using this right now!*)
- [AWS Code](https://gist.github.com/alyoshenka/eefe9ad7b53b275c895f0dbe696694ec): Authentication, message routing logic, scheduled operation storage
